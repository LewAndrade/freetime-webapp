# What is this.
This is a personal project to test my habilities with the NextJS framework and the Notion Public API.

This webapp connects to a database on my Notion Workspace where I place activites to do in my free time, categorized by type of activity.
The app randomly chooses one activity based on what type is selected when I press the button.
